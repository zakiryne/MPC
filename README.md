# MPC Control
Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Term 2, Project 5

![Final Result](./Video/MPC.gif)

## Project Basics
Using Model Predictive Control (MPC), this project involves writing a C++ program that can drive a simulated car around a virtual track using specific waypoints from the track itself. The simulated car's actuators have a 100ms latency (delay) that must be accounted for as well as part of the MPC calculation.

### Project Steps
* Fitting a line based on road waypoints and evaluating the current state based on that polynomial line.
* Implementing the MPC calculation, including setting variables and constraints
* Calculating actuator values from the MPC calc based on current state
* Accounting for latency (I used a predicted state 100ms in the future to replace the actual current state in the calculation)
* Calculating steering angle & throttle/brake based on the actuator values
* Setting timestep length and duration
* Testing/tuning of above implementations on Udacity simulator

### Results
See video of the results from my implementation [here](./Video/MPC.mp4). The car is able to approach speeds of nearly 100 mph, with only a few hitches in its planned route (which it self-corrects for in the following timestep).

## Discussion/Reflection
### The Model
My MPC model starts out by taking in certain information from the simulator: 
* ptsx (x-position of waypoints ahead on the track in global coordinates)
* ptsy (y-position of waypoints ahead on the track in global coordinates)
* px (current x-position of the vehicle's position in global coordinates)
* py (current y-position of the vehicle's position in global coordinates)
* psi (current orientation angle of the vehicle, converted from the simulator's format to that expected in mathematical formulas)
* v (current velocity of the vehicle)
* delta (current steering angle of the car, i.e. where the wheels are turned, as opposed to the actual orientation of the car in the simulator at that point [psi])
* a (current throttle)

#### Polynomial Fitting & Preprocessing
Now, in order to simplify the calculations, I transform the points from the simulator's global coordinates into the vehicle's coordinates. This is done in lines 102-107 of `main.cpp`. First, each of the waypoints are adjusted by subtracting out px and py accordingly such that they are based on the vehicle's position. Next, the waypoint coordinates are changed using standard 2d vector transformation equations to be in vehicle coordinates:
* ptsx_car[i] = x * cos(-psi) - y * sin(-psi)
* ptsy_car[i] = x * sin(-psi) + y * cos(-psi)

Using the `polyfit()` function, a third-degree polynomial line is fit to these transformed waypoints, essentially drawing the path the vehicle should try to travel. Moving on further is where the transformations are critical - because we are operating from the vehicle's coordinates, we can use px, py and psi all equal to zero: from the vehicle's standpoint, it is the center of the coordinate system, and it is always pointing to a zero orientation. The cross-track error can then be calculated by evaluating the polynomial function (`polyeval()`) at px (which in this case is now zero, so technically could also just be calculated as the first coefficient value - i.e. the one with a zero-order x). The psi error, or epsi, which is calculated from the derivative of polynomial fit line, is therefore simpler to calculate, as polynomials above the first order in the original equation are all eliminated through multiplication by zero (since x is zero). It is the negative arc tangent of the second coefficient (the first-order x was in the original polynomial).

#### Accounting for Latency
In what was perhaps the most important aspect of this project, my model then accounts for the simulator's added 100ms latency between the actuator calculation (when the model tells the car to perform a steering or acceleration/braking change) and when the simulator will actually perform that action. I originally tried to account for this by changing the N and dt values within `MPC.cpp`, but found that to be in an incorrect approach, as while my initial attempts held the line well at the beginning, it always failed to initiate a turn in time to not run off the track at the first curve.

To implement this, I added in a step to predict where the vehicle would be after 100ms (0.1 seconds), in order to take the action that needed to actually be taken at that time, instead of the one in reaction to an old situation. I set the "dt" value here (not to be confused with the one in `MPC.cpp`, although both are the same value) to equal the latency. Then, using the same update equations as those used in the actual MPC model, I predicted the state and fed that into the true model. Note that these equations were able to be simplified again because of the coordinate system transformation - using x, y and psi all of zero made these equations a little simpler, as lots of the values end up being zero or one. See lines 131-143 in `main.cpp`. This new predicted state, along with the coefficients, are then fed into the `mpc.Solve()` function found in `MPC.cpp`.

#### MPC.cpp - Where the Magic Happens
Within the MPC class's `Solve()` function, the independent variables (based off of the state size, actuators, and timesteps) are first set to zero besides the first variable, which is set to the input current (or in my implementation including latency, predicted) state. The variables then have upper and lower boundaries set for their values. I kept the defaults from the Udacity lessons, which pretty much took most values in for the incoming state values (Lines 179-182), while limiting delta (steering angle) within limits of -25 to 25 degrees (in radians here - see lines 186-189) and "a" (throttle, lines 192-195)  within -1 to 1. These limits for delta and "a" are based on the simulated vehicle having max steering angles and maximum throttle or breaking of these values. Constraints are then set similarly to how variables were begun, with zero for all values other than the initial (based on input state).

Now on to the FG_eval class. This first creates cost functions for each of the variables. Note that I also utilized weights here for each cost - it is extremely important to do this, as lower weights related to cte and epsi lead to the model not focusing enough on staying near the center of the road and turning correctly. Lower values often led to the cars driving off the track. Although getting up to speed is important (note that I set a max speed with ref_v at Line 27 at 120, although 100 mph maintains fairly similar results due to the model placing significantly higher importance on cte and epsi), it should not be the focus of the vehicle. The velocity cost is essentially there so that the car never stops. The costs related to delta and "a", and especially the costs related to the changes of those values, are important as well. Putting more weight to delta_change helps the ride to be much smoother, or closer to how a human being would drive.

From here, the updated cost constraints are calculated by first calculating the states at time t and time + 1. These states are then put through the update equations (Lines 125-130), such as the given y cost constraint being equal to y1 - (y0 + v0 * sin(psi) * dt). This, along with the variables and constraints calculated earlier, can be fed to the `ipopt` solver. This solver takes in all the information and will calculate the future predicted states, which also includes updated delta and "a" values that I use for my actuator values. Lines 258-266 return the important parts of this solution vector, which includes my actuator values as well as predictions for the vehicle's upcoming path it will take.

### Back to The Simulator
Back in `main.cpp`, the first variable back from the `MPC.Solve()` function is delta. This value needs to be divided by deg2rad(25) to normalize it, as well as being multiplied by Lf in order to account for the vehicle's turning radius. The second value, "a", can be used directly as the throttle value. These are then sent back to the json model for the simulator to use. See Lines 155-161.

We can also use the remaining variables from `MPC.Solve()`, which I purposefully set as the output x and y coordinates from the MPC model, to draw a line in the simulator showing the car's current predicted future path. This is drawn in green in the simulator, and shows how different the model's current expected path is compared to what a path directly through the waypoints would be. Note that I started with the beginning state values from before the solve function so that the line would begin near the vehicle. See Lines 164-176 in `main.cpp`.

The yellow line through the waypoints is pretty easy, as I just take desired x-coordinates and put them into the polynomial line to evaluate for the given y-value (from my earlier calculated coefficients). See Lines 184-193.

#### Tuning Timesteps (N) and Timestep Duration (dt) in MPC.cpp
The last step, now that I was visualizing the model in the simulator, was to tune Timesteps (N) and Timestep Duration (dt) in `MPC.cpp`. I originally was using values of 15 for N and 0.2 for dt, because I thought 3 second (15 x 0.2 seconds) would be a good prediction span, and I also had thought I could account for latency in this way. However, I found 0.2 to be way too slow to react, plus I began accounting for latency in the `main.cpp` file. I also found the model seemed to slow down if N was higher, so I eventually settled on 10 for N, which meant that with 0.1 dt, I was only predicting for one second essentially. Given that the car can reach speeds of nearly 100 mph without any extremely erratic driving, this looks to be a great final spot for N and dt.
